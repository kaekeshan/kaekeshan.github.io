HTML helps to add structure to the webpage.  
current version of html = [html5](https://html.com/html5/)
The first file to parse will be ==index.html==.  
Common terms to note down are element (set of start, end tags and content in b/w).  
For example: ```<p> This is a an example of element</p>```  
The start tag is : ```<TAG_NAME>```  
The end tag is : ```</TAG_NAME>```
Concept of parent-child relation is important in HTML

#### Basic Structure of an HTML document

```html

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- requried preamble -->
<html lang="en">
  <head> <!-- to delcare metadata, styles, script etc.. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
    <link rel="icon" href="./favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
  </head>
  <body> <!-- page content goes here -->
    <main>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>  
    </main>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

```

#### Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that convey the meaning and structure of web content, rather than just its appearance.  
Semantic elements clearly describe their purpose both to the browser and to developers, making web pages more accessible, easier to maintain, and better for SEO.

- Why use Semantic HTML ?
    - ==Accessibility==: Screen readers and assistive technologies can better interpret the content.
    - ==SEO==: Search engines can better understand and rank your content.
    - ==Maintainability==: Code is easier to read and maintain for developers.

##### Non-Semantic

```html
<div id="header">My Website</div>
<div id="nav">Home | About | Contact</div>
<div id="content">Welcome to my website!</div>
```

##### Semantic

```html
<header>My Website</header>
<nav>Home | About | Contact</nav>
<main>Welcome to my website!</main>
```
